# AdaptIT_-Excercise
Hi,

Instruction in document were unclear at times but left comment in code as I understood questions.
No input data or test cases were provided.

As for database question 3, I was unsure to what depths to go in creating database as no marks allocated and didn't specify. Could of added much more fields like "patient history" but did not want to over complicate task and spend extra time when was unnecessary.

Hope you able to run code and feel free to ask when something not clear?

Regards
Robert
